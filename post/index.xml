      <description>&lt;p&gt;And it was when I finally decided to get myself some sort of general purpose site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea starts to concern every developer at some point. in one way or another everyone of us needs to store somewhere all of his/her ideas/thoughts/etc and preferably in one place.
Some create their one site from the scratch, others use one of the blogging platforms.
First approach is not interesting for me just because its not challenging or educational and second one seems to be not so adjustable and requires to much steps.
So, static site generator, markdown and github pages seems like silver bullet, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets see how it&amp;rsquo;ll go.&lt;/p&gt;
