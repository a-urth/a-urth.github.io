And it was when I finally decided to create site or sort of.
This idea concern every developer in one way or another just because everyone of us needs to store somewhere all of his/her ideas/thoughts/etc and preferable in one place.
Some create their one site from the scratch, other use one the blogging platforms.
First one is not interesting for me just because its not challenging and second one seems to be to so adjustable and requires to much steps.
So, static site generator, markdown and github pages seems like silver bullet, at least for now.
Lets see how it'll go.
